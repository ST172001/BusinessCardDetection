<h3>Welcome to Project "Intelligently Extract Text & Data from Document with OCR NER" !!!</h3>

    <p>  
        The main idea of this project is to extract entities from the scanned documents like invoice, 
        Business Card, Shipping Bill, Bill of Lading documents etc. However, 
        for the sake of data privacy we restricted our views to Business Card. 
        But you can use the framework explained to all kinds of financial documents. 
        To develop this project we will use two main technologies in data science are,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Computer Vision</li>
            <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
        </ol>
        
    <p>
        In Computer Vision module, we will scan the document, identify the location of text and finally extract text from the image. 
        Then in Natural language processing, 
        we will extract the entitles from the text and do necessary text cleaning and parse the entities form the text.
